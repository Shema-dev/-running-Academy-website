The front end of the website can be accessed by anyone who is searching for information related to the academy, while the database can only be accessed through a secure login process, which is restricted to the authorized personnel only.

The admin portal allows authorized personnel to perform various tasks related to managing the athletes' profiles. These tasks include editing existing athlete profiles, creating new athlete profiles, updating athlete profiles, and deleting athlete profiles. This ensures that the athlete information is always up-to-date and accurate.

Furthermore, the admin portal also provides a list of all the users who have access to the portal. This feature helps the admin to keep track of who has access to sensitive athlete information and control access permissions if necessary.

In summary, the website's database system, along with the admin portal, provides a secure and efficient way to manage athlete profiles and user feedback. It ensures that the website is always up-to-date and serves as a valuable resource for anyone searching for information related to the academy.
